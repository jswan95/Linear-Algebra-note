    "The key equation we mentioned last lecture is:\n",

    "$$Ax = \\lambda x$$\n",

    "By solving $\\operatorname{det}(A-\\lambda I)=0$, we can get eigenvalue $\\lambda$, then substituting it to the key equation gives us eigenvector $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to use eigenvalues and eigenvectors? One of the use is diagonalizing a matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose matrix $A$ has $n$ independent eigenvectors $x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n$, we put these eigenvectors in columns of matrix $S$, which is eigenvector matrix. Then we can use the following equation to diagonalize matrix $A$:\n",

    "$$A=S \\Lambda S^{-1} \\Leftrightarrow S^{-1} A S=\\Lambda$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to calculate $A^2$ using this formula. \n",
    "* $Ax=\\lambda x \\Leftrightarrow A^2x=\\lambda Ax =\\lambda^2 x$, which shows that for matrix $A^2$, its eigenvalue is also squared but the eigenvector does not change. \n",
    "* If we use $A= S \\Lambda S^{-1}$, $A^2 = S \\Lambda S^{-1} S \\Lambda S^{-1}=S \\Lambda^{2} S^{-1}$ showing the same that eigenvalue squared but eigenvector does not change. \n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we can easily calculate $A^k$ by using $A^{k}=S \\Lambda^{k} S^{-1}$, where $\\Lambda =\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\n",
    "\\lambda_{1}^{k} & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n",

    "Again let's investigate what kind of matrix can be diagonalizable?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a matrix has $n$ different eigenvalues (no repeated eigenvalues), then the matrix is sure to have $n$ independent eigenvectors, thus the matrix is diagonalizable. \n",
    "* If a matrix has repeated eigenvalues, it may have $n$ independent eigenvectors. For example, 10 dimensional identity matrix $I_{10}$ has 10 same eigenvalues 1, but it has 10 independent eigenvectors. \n",
    "* But for the case $A=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "2 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 2\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right]$, solving the characteristic equation gives us two repeated eigenvalues. $\\operatorname{det}(A-\\lambda I)=\\left|\\begin{array}{cc}2-\\lambda & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2-\\lambda\\end{array}\\right|=(2-\\lambda)^{2}=0 \\Rightarrow \\lambda_{1}=\\lambda_{2}=2$. Substituting it to $Ax=\\lambda x$, we obtain eigenvectors $x_{1}=x_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}1 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right]$, they are not independent. This is the `denegerate matrix` we mentioned last lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two concepts:\n",
    "* Algebraic multiplicity: the repeated times of eigenvalues\n",
    "* Geometric multiplicity: the dimension of the null space $(A-\\lambda I)$ associated with eigenvalue $\\lambda$, or the maximum number of linear independent eigenvectors associated with $\\lambda$ is referred to as the eigenvalue's geometric multiplicity. "
